    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pad thai is made with rehydrated dried rice noodles with some tapioca flour mixed in, which are stir fried with eggs
            and chopped firm tofu, flavored with tamarind juice, fish sauce, dried shrimp, garlic or shallots, red chili pepper
            and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges and often chopped roasted peanuts.[3] It may contain other vegetables
            like bean sprouts, garlic chives, pickled radishes or turnips, and raw banana flowers. It may also contain fresh shrimp,
            crab, squid, chicken or other fish or meat.

            Many of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments, such as the red chili pepper, lime wedges, 
            roasted peanuts, bean sprouts, spring onion and other miscellaneous fresh vegetables.[4] Vegetarian versions may 
            substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce and omit the shrimp entirely.
